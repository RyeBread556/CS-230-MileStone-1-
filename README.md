# CS-230-MileStone-1-

the point of this assignment was to go through each indiviual file and fill in the FIXME sections, #1 needed to utilize the UML Simpleton pattern and icorporate it within a class, # 2,3,4 needed use of the UML Iterator pattern used to find the names and ID of a paticular game object from a List, #4 and 5 needed both a local and normal reference to the GameService class within the GameService.java file. The rest of the code was pre-written for this assignment and was not the result of myself.
